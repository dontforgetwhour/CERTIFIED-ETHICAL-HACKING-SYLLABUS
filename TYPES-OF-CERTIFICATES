:-INTRODUCTION......
   Ethical hacking and penetration testing require a structured learning approach.certifications validate your skills and help you to advance in cyber security field.
Below is a road map covering entry-level to expert certifications.
1.Beginner level certifications.
   At this stage,you build foundatinal knowledge of ethical hacking, security principles,and penetration testing.
compTIA security+
  . covers basic security concepts.
  . prerequisite for many cybersecurity careers.
  . recommended for absolute beginners.
CEH(CERTIFIED ETHICAL HACKER).
  . provided by EC-Council.
  . covers ethical hacking tools,methodologies,and attack techniques.
